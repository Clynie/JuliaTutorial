# Introduction

This folder contains my Julia tutorials (aimed at students in finance and economics). 

# Instructions

1.  Most files are jupyter notebooks. Click one of them to see it online. If GitHub fails to render the notebook, then use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). Instructions: try to open the notebook in GitHub, copy the link and paste it in the address field of nbviewer.
2.  To download this repository, use the Download (as zip) in the Github menu.


# On the files

1. The .jl files are functions used in some of the notebooks.

2. Tutorial_ChapterNumber_Topic.ipynb are (relatively) short notebooks organised around different topics.

3. The current version is tested on Julia 1.1.

4.  The subfolder Data contains some data sets used in the programs, while the subfolder Results is for output.
